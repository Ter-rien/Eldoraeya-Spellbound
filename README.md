Eldoraeya: Spellbound is an interactive browser game mixing roguelike runs, choose-your-own-adventure storytelling, and deck-building mechanics.

## Story and Lore

### World of Eldoraeya
Eldoraeya is a land of magic and diversity‚Äîmystical forests, volcanic peaks, sprawling deserts, and port cities bustling with humans, elves, dwarves, and beyond. Magic once surged through all, but the Eclipse Enclave's chrono-tech experiments, led by Archmage Darius Darkweave, are sapping it dry. With a chrono-compass‚Äîan ancient artifact humming with temporal energy‚Äîyou, a novice mage, aim to master magic, halt the Enclave, and reach Skyreach Castle, a floating nexus tying all paths together.

### Cities
Each city has a distinct vibe, elemental school, and companion:

- **Emberpeak**: Volcanic forge city of fire mages. School: Elemental Fire. Companion: [TBD]. Lava channels light the streets; statues of fire elementals dance with flames.
- **Mysthaven**: Plains hub of arcane study (Illusion) and divine magic (Healing/Protection at the Grand Temple of Light). Companion: Esseris Rainsworth. Home to the Grand Library, Enchanted Markets, and Grand Temple of Light.
- **Sylvan Glade**: Elven forest of nature magic. School: Nature. Companion: Elara Starfall. Living wood spires rise amid a non-interventionist High Elf Council led by Thalorian Starfall.

### Characters
- **Player**: A young mage in a robe, wielding an Eldertree staff and a chrono-compass, a glowing relic that channels the Chronomancer's voice
- **Chronomancer (DM)**: Therondar Kaelthorne, once Darius Darkweave's master, now a sardonic voice in the chrono-compass after a betrayal-fueled chrono-tech disaster erased his memories. He narrates with wit and melancholy, his past unfolding across runs
- **Companions**: City-specific allies like Esseris (Mysthaven), Elara (Sylvan Glade), and Lyria (Riverbloom). Other cities may offer temporary allies or quest-givers:
  - **Esseris Rainsworth**: Human mage from Mysthaven. Water/ice specialist, sharp-witted and aloof yet loyal. Met at the Grand Library or defending travelers
  - **Elara Starfall** (alias Moonrise): Elven druid from Sylvan Glade. Noble, serene, and nature-bound, she defies her council to fight the Enclave. Met at Mysthaven markets or mid-ambush
  - **Lyria Lightsong**: Half-elf cleric from Riverbloom. Kind, mature healer with light magic, seeking dark magic's source. Met at the Grand Temple or a roadside shrine

## Additional Notes

- **Game State**: Managed in `main.js`, saved via LocalStorage
- **API Calls**: Grok narration pulls from `gameData` and `gameState`
- **Story Pieces**: Modular types (Story, Combat, Encounter, Event) in `data.js`
- **Combat**: Turn-based, with card play and enemy intents
- **Lore**: Cities, elemental schools, and chrono-tech weave the narrative
- **Chronomancer Backstory**: Chronomancer (DM): Meet Therondar Kaelthorne, your not-so-humble guide. Once the master who taught Darius Darkweave the ropes of Temporal Magic, he was blindsided when his star pupil turned traitor. A chrono-tech experiment‚ÄîDarius's bright idea‚Äîwent spectacularly awry, shredding Therondar's memories and leaving him a sardonic whisper in the chrono-compass. He'd warned against meddling with forbidden time-trickery, but pride's a stubborn beast. Now, he narrates your tale with dry wit and a touch of gloom, tossing out quips like, "Oh, splendid choice‚Äîlet's see if it kills us slower this time." His lost past unravels across runs, peaking in the dystopian twist when he finally recalls who he was‚Äîand what Darius cost him.
- **Bosses**: Crimson Warlock (Dunespire), Lady Mirella (Emberpeak), Thornfang (Sylvan Glade), Captain Blackmaw (Tidegarde), Zephyros (Skyreach), Darius (Shadow Spire)
- **Endgame**: Post-Darius, decide the fate of chrono-tech artifacts‚Äîrestore magic or bury the past
